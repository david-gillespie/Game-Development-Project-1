# Game-Development-Project-1
By David Gillespie and Judah Goff

repo: https://github.com/david-gillespie/Game-Development-Project-1
Summary: The program is four games.  First is a bowling game. Second is a racing game.  Third is a jumping coin collecting game, and finally a 3d pacman maze game.  The game is played solely with the keyboard (arrow keys), left shift, escape to pause, and space to jump.  
Bugs remaining: Project must be built in the same folder as the assets/resources folder with the two text files for the High Scores list to properly work in a Build & Run mode. In the editor, the high scores always works. 

What each teammate contributed: 
Judah: main menu, jump, race, highscores
David: Maze, Bowling levels, highscores

percentage: 50/50
